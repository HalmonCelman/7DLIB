If you use platform that isn't in README you must write by yourself low level drivers
two functions: dled_init(), dled_int()

how to write dled_init() ?

1. always at start on the functions write:
	
	number_7dlib=0;
    	for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
    	buffer_7dlib[i]=0;
    	}
    	
    what this do?
    number_7dlib is a counter thats point which digit is now displayed, so we starts from first digit
    buffer_7dlib[] is a buffer for digits - which char we are displaying, so we are clearing display

2. next step is to initialize ports:
	all ports: from A to G and from DIG1 to DIG4 must be as an output
	pins DIG1, DIG2, DIG3, DIG4 must br in low logical state
	pins D_A, D_B, ... D_G must be in high logical state

it's all!

how to write dled_int() ?

1. at first step you must see which digit will be now displayed and set to high logical state this pin and set to low state pin before.
For example if number_7dlib=0 then DIG1 must be set to high logical state, and DIG4 to low state
if number_7dlib=1 then DIG2 high, and DIG1 low etc.

2. second step is to set the fragments that should be set
format of data in display buffer( buffer_7dlib[] ):
0b 0 x x x x x x x
     ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
     | | | | | | |
     G F E D C B A
     
if x=1 then this fragment should be set( low logic state )
if x=0 then this fragment should be cleared( high logic state )

For example:
if( buffer_7dlib[number_7dlib] & 0b00000001 ){ //if A is set
low state on PIN A
}else{
high level on pin A
}

if( buffer_7dlib[number_7dlib] & 0b00000010 ){ //if B is set
low state on PIN B
}else{
high level on pin B
}

etc.


3. last step is to incerese digit which we are displaying
( of course it can't be higher than 3 cause we have only 4 digits)

number_7dlib++;
if(number_7dlib>3) //if higher than 3
    number_7dlib=0; //return to the first



it's all, now you should do what's in README
