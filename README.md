# 7DLIB
It's a library for 7 segment 4 digits display LED with common anode
It's completely free to commercial and non-commercial use, but you must give information that this library was written by KK


platform: ATTiny2313 (default for AVR) or STM32H725VGxx(default for STM32) but all code is written to work on all platforms 

see schematic( in folder schemat_i_inne ) to all information of example usage of this library

How to use?
'''
	 1. Create project or makefile with all files from library( DLED.c, DLED.h, DLED_config.h )
    	 2. Configure DLED_SYS in DLED_config.h:
	 	select platform on which you are:
	 		0-AVR 
	 		1-STM32(not yet done)
	 		2,3,.. - another platform â†“
	 		you must write by yourself low level drivers, see file low_level.txt to more information
	 
    	 	3. Configure all connections in dled_configure.h
	 
    	 	4. You must generate interval to use dled_int(), the best option is to generate 
    	 	 interval 200 times per second to 50Hz refreshing rate (mulitplexing)

    it's all! you can now modify what is on screen with dled_set() and other functions
    ( all functions are described in functions.txt )
'''
How to use example?
'''
	 1. Connect all same as in schematic 
	 2. Do point 1 and 2 from "how to use"
	 3. Copy and paste main.c to your project instead of main.c which you already have
    	 See if it's working.

Have fun with this library ;)
